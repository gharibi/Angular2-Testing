# Angular2 testing sample using Jasmine & Karma
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.2. This project consumes Pokemon API and generates sample Bootstrap panels. Each of the panels illustrate the Pokemon pictures. Lazy loading mechanism is used to fetch the results of this API. In this project various unit test are setup to validate the main functions of the application.
